                <h1>Catherine P. Dilan</h1>
                <p>	Born and raised in the quaint town of Cabaruan, Urdaneta City, my journey through life has been accompanied by the soothing melodies of "Killing Me Softly with His Song" by the Fugees. Nestled in the heart of the Philippines, my love for literature was kindled by the enchanting pages of Alyloony's "She who stole Cupid’s Arrow." As I navigated the corridors of education, my academic pursuit led me to the path of enlightenment in Bachelor of Secondary Education with a major in Social Studies. Embracing the wisdom of Horace, I hold dear the belief that "Vitiis nemo sine nascitur" – that no one is born without faults. Through the chapters of my life, I strive to learn, grow, and weave my narrative into the rich tapestry of human experience. </p>
